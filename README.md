How to prepare my noodles 
- I think of noodles 
- I assess the price of noodles 
- I look at my budget 
- I make up my mind how many noodles I want to buy 
- I go out and buy the noodles 
- I also buy some condiments to make my noodles tastier
- I get home and begin boiling my eggs first cos the duration of cooking noodles  cannot properly boil eggs
- I blend my peppers
- I dice my other proteins(suya) and keep them in a bowl 
- i put the noodles seasoning with the blended peppers and bring them 5o simmer for 2 minutes.
- I then crush my noodles to tiny bits and pour them into the already savory pepper 

and seasoning mix
- I wait for the noodles to almost be ready, then I pour in the dice suya 
- By then, the egg should have been properly boiled, so I remove it and put it In a freezer for 5 minutes before putting it in water, this helps the egg peel easier 
- I serve my suya noodles and put the peeled eggs on top
